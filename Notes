Problems ran into during development

(1). Role exists errors: Login as the IAM User to AWS Management Console and delete those roles created

Error: Error creating IAM Role terraform-eks-ec-cluster: EntityAlreadyExists: Role with name terraform-eks-ec-cluster already exists.
	status code: 409, request id: 13746e5c-de2e-11e9-b025-0b42a5fb5203

  on eks-cluster.tf line 8, in resource "aws_iam_role" "ec-cluster":
   8: resource "aws_iam_role" "ec-cluster" {

  on eks-worker-nodes.tf line 10, in resource "aws_iam_role" "ec-node":
  10: resource "aws_iam_role" "ec-node" {
  
  (2). Delete *.tfstate files in the terraform code folder
       Delete .terraform directory
       Delete .kube directory

(3) Another error: Not sure where to find that profile, I changed the name if that tf file and problem solved:

Error: Error creating IAM instance profile terraform-eks-ec: EntityAlreadyExists: Instance Profile terraform-eks-ec already exists.
	status code: 409, request id: 0aa7e066-de43-11e9-b0da-697c596ef9cc

  on ec-worker-nodes.tf line 44, in resource "aws_iam_instance_profile" "ec-node":
  44: resource "aws_iam_instance_profile" "ec-node" {

I was able to create the cluster.
