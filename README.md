Stress-testing an E-Commerce architecture based on Kubernetes+istio for prime-time workloads

Business Case: At 2018 Prime time sales - 3 minutes after opening, the famous e-commerce website crashed. The e-commerce site was not able to handle the traffic surge. Cascading failures experienced in the next few hours. On the other hand, other e-commerce giants had gained successful expereince in their shopping festival campaigns in the past several years without major glitches.

Motivation: This project proposes hybrid stress-testing strategies for preparing the next Prime time sales. It implements an e-commerce architecture based on Kubernetes and service mesh. Stress-testing will be applied to the e-commerce microservices applications to simulate real workloads.

Engineering Challenges:

- limited compute resources to simulate real workloads
- Simulated stree testing to reveal most bottlenecks
- AI-powered strategies in case of hardware resources exhaustion
